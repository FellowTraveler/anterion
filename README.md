# ü§ñ Anterion Agent

## üìñ What is Anterion?

Anterion is an open-source AI software engineer.

Anterion extends the capabilities of `SWE-agent` to plan and execute open-ended engineering tasks, with a frontend inspired by
`OpenDevin`.

We've equiped Anterion with easy deployment and UI to allow you to fix bugs and prototype ideas at ease.

## üèÅ Getting Started

üéâ Get on board with Anterion by doing the following! üéâ

### Prerequisites
* Linux, Mac OS, or [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) >= 18.17.1
* [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/)

You will need to setup all three components of the system before being able to run it:

### 1. `OpenDevin` Setup

Before setting up OpenDevin, make a new conda environment and activate
it by doing the following:

```bash
conda create --name anterion python=3.11
conda activate anterion
```

To setup OpenDevin, run the following command in the `anterion` directory:

```bash
make build-open-devin
```

### 2. `SWE-agent` Setup

Next you will need to setup the `SWE-agent`.

To start, you will need to `cd` to the `SWE-agent` directory, and run the following
command:

```bash
cd SWE-agent
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate swe-agent
cd ..
```

You will need to create a file called `keys.cfg` inside of the `SWE-agent`
directory:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY: '<OPENAI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE>'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: '<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_GOES_HERE>'
GITHUB_TOKEN: '<GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>'
```

(Optionally) If you want to be able to use Netlify deployments, add the following
`.env` file inside of the `SWE-agent` directory:

```bash
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="<NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>"
NETLIFY_SITE_ID="<NETLIFY_SITE_ID_GOES_HERE>"
```

Run the following command inside of the `anterion` directory to setup `SWE-agent`

```bash
make build-swe-agent
```

### 3. `microservice` Setup

Finally you need to setup the `microservice`, which ties together the
`OpenDevin` frontend and the `SWE-agent` agent.

First, within the `microservice` directory, create a new
directory called `docker_volume` which will be used to contain
the agents Docker container will store files within.

```bash
cd ./microservice
mkdir docker_volume
cd ..
```

Then you need to create a `.env` file in the `microservice` directory
like the following:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_GOES_HERE>
SWE_AGENT_PATH=<SWE_AGENT_PATH_GOES_HERE>
PYTHON_PATH=<PATH_TO_SWE_AGENT_PYTHON_BINARY_GOES_HERE>

DOCKER_HOST_VOLUME_PATH=<PATH_TO_DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY_GOES_HERE>
DOCKER_CONTAINER_VOLUME_PATH=/usr/app

SWE_AGENT_PER_INSTANCE_COST_LIMIT=<MAX_USD_PER_AGENT_TASK>
SWE_AGENT_TIMEOUT=25
SWE_AGENT_MODEL_NAME=gpt4
```

Next, reactivate the conda environment using:

```bash
conda activate anterion
```


Finally, run the following command to build the microservice:

```bash
make build-microservice
```



### Usage

To now run Anterion, you need to be in the `anterion` environment using:

```bash
conda activate anterion
```

Then you need to run the frontend and the backend.
Run the following command to run both together:

```bash
./run.sh
```

You may have to change permissions for the file first:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

If that isn't working for some reason, run both of them separately:

```bash
make run-frontend
```

```bash
make run-backend
```
